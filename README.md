# Melvi-l

Most of the time, I touch grass and live life. Then sometimes, i do little silly useless but fun project.

The last one is my little silly overengineer [node-editor-webgpu](https://github.com/melvi-l/node-editor-webgpu) and the little silly lib I built to stay dependancy free (It's my Terry Davis side):
* [color-picker-webgpu](https://github.com/melvi-l/color-picker-webgpu)
* [kuai-ts](https://github.com/melvi-l/kuai-ts)

I code on nvim-tmux with a [corn](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), but I am a c*rporate girlieâ„¢ so all of this runs inside WSL.
